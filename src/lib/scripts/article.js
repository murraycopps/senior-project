"When somebody does a great performance now, everybody will question if it's the shoe, and that is the credibility problem." Karsten Warholm 400 hurdle world record holder [quote][top]

In 2017 Nike shook the running world with their Breaking 2 project, a highly-publicized race featuring three elite athletes aiming to break the 2-hour marathon barrier. The runners finished just outside of 2 hours with Eliud Kipchoge running 2:00:25 - an impressive 2-and-a-half minutes faster than the world record. Unfortunately, this performance wasn't recognized as a world record because of the rotating pacers the runners were wearing the groundbreaking Nike Vaporfly 4% which was crucial to their success. These shoes feature an energy-returning foam and carbon plate that when combined are claimed to return 4% of the energy the runner usually loses to the ground.

	Is 4% a lot of energy? [title]

If an average runner runs 4% faster over a marathon their time would improve by 10 minutes. While 10 minutes doesn't seem like a lot, over an entire marathon it is incredibly impressive to drop in a sport where the top runners have to train for years to drop a minute. Looking at the time of the fastest marathon before super shoes came out, athletes running 5 minutes slower in normal shoes could theoretically break the world record. Initially, this appears to be a massive threat to the integrity of athletics but 4% more efficiency does not equal 4% faster, especially at faster paces. 

	If you look at the start of any race you will see an overwhelming number of super shoes. Elite athletes need them to be competitive and are sponsored so their super shoes make sense but what doesn't seem immediately obvious is why the sub-elite and amateur runners wear them too. Those runners have to pay $250 out of pocket for a shoe that might need to be replaced before 150 miles which means that on top of the entry fees the athletes running marathons basically spend 40$ each just for the shoes. This makes that slight energy boost a costly thing but many people still find it worth it.

Is it fair?[title]

These amazing shoes provide serious benefits that help runners run faster and recover faster allowing them to train more optimally and improve their race times. The time improvement could allow previously untouchable records to be beaten by athletes that aren't as good but can run faster. Usain Bolt, the world record holder in the 100 and 200 meters has spoken out about these advances saying that they were “weird and unfair”. He believes that he could have run faster than 9.5 seconds if he had access to them when he was competing. The former marathon world record holder, Tegla Loroupe, has spoken out about these shoes saying these are similar to cheating. 

While it is obvious that improvements to shoes will threaten records, this has always been happening to some extent, and will always happen. A major example is how hard it was to break 4 in the mile for the first time but how last year there were 6 high school athletes in the U.S. able to break that same barrier. The main controversy was created by how huge of a jump this technology was. It also was caused by how having more foam was suddenly faster instead of slower so companies could pack more and more foam in and create more efficient shoes. This could easily be prevented by adding a max stack height to the rules.

Sponsorships [title]

The most harm these shoes can do is with the discrepancies between companies. Some companies create better shoes than other companies which leave many athletes with a hard choice to make. Many athletes are able to get a good deal with a company that doesn't have great shoes but if they want the best shoes they need to sign a bad deal, Nike severely underpays most of its athletes. That is if those athletes are lucky enough to get a deal with better companies, most are forced to go unsponsored if they want a chance to compete with shoes that give them a chance against the best. The fastest U.S. athletes at the Boston Marathon last year in both the men's and women's races had both recently dropped their sponsorship deals and competed in the fastest shoe on the market, the Nike Alphafly. 

 "If the best are willing to take $0 from a shoe sponsor because they feel they need VF [i.e., the Vaporfly, the Alphafly's predecessor] to be competitive, why would Nike pay them? And what can the next tier possibly ask for?" Des Linden winner of Boston 2018 [quote]

"It's actually taking away opportunity, because unless the one company that works best for you thinks you are a perfect match you may never be sponsored." two-time Olympian Kara Goucher [quote]


The Tokyo Olympic 400-meter hurdles were an impressive race where Warholm improved his record by .76 seconds, an incredible margin in such a short event, and three of the finishers broke his previous record. After the race, he spoke out about the shoes of the second-place runner and complained about how they impacted his performance despite wearing super shoes, although worse as he was sponsored by Puma instead of Nike. He later went on to say how he doesn't know which shoes are better.

What should be done? [title]

It is undisputed that these shoes are unfair but a normal part of advancement and that something needs to be done to keep these shoes fair for all athletes but everyone disagrees with how to do this. The most important step was to ban shoes with multiple plates stacked(an extra spike plate is fine but it cannot be connected to the other plate) to avoid shoes that created a spring effect. This ruined the original plans for the Nike Alphaflys which was to feature 3 carbon plates and completely made the Nike Viperflys illegal. 

The other rule limiting the shoe technology was a stack height rule that prevented track spikes from having more than 20mm of foam and road shoes from having more than 40mm. What this does is control the amount of the responsive foam that makes these shoes so fast.

To keep it fair for all athletes shoes must be made available to everyone for a reasonable price and a certain amount of time before the competitions they are used in so that athletes that are unsponsored can have access to them. 

This only does a little to help the athletes who are faced with the hard choice of shoes or money but it is a good first step. The best thing to help athletes was when other shoes started coming out with super shoes, Nike still makes the best shoes but they are close enough that it depends more on how they work with you instead of which is the best in the labs. Another option some athletes managed to get was signing with a company but being able to race in whatever shoes they want. 

These rules are overall fair and limit excessive progress while allowing some progress to happen. They provide a good balance which became a necessity after the controversy that followed the development of these shoes since they were released to the public.
